# Life_Expectancy_Analysis

This project uses Python to analyze a dataset that contains information about global life expectancy. The goal of this analysis is to find out which factors contribute the most to overall life expectancy. 

## Tools used 
- Various Python libraries were used including Pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, Seaborn, and Folium. 
- Exploratory visual analysis was performed by generating heat maps and scatterplots.
- Geospatial analysis was conducted by using a JSON file and applying it to the dataset.
- Supervised machine learning via a linear regression model.
- Unsupervised machine learning via a k-means cluster model.
- Time series analysis.

## Data
